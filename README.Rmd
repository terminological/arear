The goal of arear is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of arear from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("arear")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("terminological/arear")
```
## Example

There are a set of maps bundled:

```{r example}
devtools::load_all()
here::i_am("README.Rmd")
options("arear.cache.dir"=here::here("data-raw/cache"))

# library(arear)
## basic example code
arear::listStandardMaps()
```

Getting and plotting a map for the UK is simple:

```{r}
map = arear::getMap("CTRY19")
nhshospitals = arear::surgecapacity %>% dplyr::filter(sector == "NHS Sector")
ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data=map)+
  geom_sf(data=nhshospitals,aes(colour=tier1))
```

But the main thing is creating a catchment area:

```{r}

apiTrusts = readr::read_csv("https://api.coronavirus.data.gov.uk/v2/data?areaType=nhsTrust&metric=hospitalCases&format=csv")

# There are quite a few mental health, and childrens trusts that we do not as yet have good capacity data for
# apiTrusts %>% select(areaCode,areaName) %>% distinct() %>% anti_join(arear::surgecapacity, by = c("areaCode"="trustId")) %>% View()

# there are however no extra trusts that never appear in the API.
# arear::surgecapacity %>% anti_join(apiTrusts, by = c("trustId"="areaCode"))

sup = arear::surgecapacity %>% semi_join(apiTrusts, by = c("trustId"="areaCode"))
dem = arear::uk2019demographicsmap %>% filter(code %>% stringr::str_starts("E")) %>% left_join(arear::uk2019adultpopulation %>% select(-name,-codeType), by="code")

catchment = arear::createCatchment(
  supplyShape = sup, 
  supplyIdVar = trustId, 
  supplyVar = hduBeds,
  demandShape = dem,
  demandIdVar = code, 
  demandVar = population,
  outputMap = TRUE
)

ggplot(catchment$map)+geom_sf()

catchment$map %>% View()


```
